# Ultimate Retro Pong


This project is a retro-styled Pong game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The game features single-player and two-player modes.  The single-player mode includes AI opponent with dynamic difficulty. The game includes sound effects, particle effects and a power-up system for enhanced gameplay. The code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns between the game logic, rendering, and user interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
[![My Tech Stack](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,javascript)](https://skillicons.dev)

HTML: Provides the basic structure and content of the game.
JavaScript: Handles the game logic, user input, and rendering.
CSS: Styles the game elements and overall user interface.

## 🏗️ Codebase Structure
The project's code is contained within a single HTML file.  This makes it straightforward, but for larger projects, a more modular structure (e.g., separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into multiple files) would be beneficial.
